# rustzx
![logo](assets/logo_small.png)

ZX Spectrum emulator which I writing in rust.
I develop this project just for fun and for learning the basics of computer
architecture.

[![RustZX CI](https://github.com/pacmancoder/rustzx/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pacmancoder/rustzx/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
## Features
- Written in pure rust
- Cross-platform
- Documented source
- Full ZX Spectrum 48K and 128K emulation
- Perfect emulation of Z80 core
- Highly precise AY chip emulation with Ayumi library
- Beeper sound emulation
- Can handle tap, sna files
- Fast loading of tap files with standard loader
- Emulates border
- Kempston joystick emulation
- Correct contentons

## Download [v0.9.2]
Packages are available in github releases.
**Note:** On linux platforms sdl2 library must be installed

## Compiling
Before compiling make shure that you have C compiller and CMate to
build bundled `sdl2`

Then just install it with cargo

```bash
cargo install
```
For advanced info use `--help` flag

## How to use
Here some examples of usage:
```bash
rustzx --help
rustzx --fastload --tap test.tap
rustzx -f --128k --AY abc --tap test128.tap
rustzx --rom tester.rom --scale 3 --volume 50
```
For loading tape in 48K mode, press `j` then `Ctrl+p` twice, as on real Spectrum.
You must see `LOAD ""` on emulator's screen. And then press `Enter`.
If you `--fastload` option before launching, game will be launched, in other
case press `Insert` to insert tape. `Delete` can be used for ejecting tape from
tape reader. `--128k` flag launches emulator in 128K mode. For loading tape just
press `Enter`.

If you have some audio troubles - use `--latency` flag with bigger samples
count.

Use keys `F3 - F5` to set speed of emulation - this can be usefull when skipping some boring stuff.
Use `F6` to display FPS in window title.

Of course, I used many resources to find out, how to build my first
emulator in life. So there is a list of useful references, from where I dig most

## ROM's
Emulator contains ROM's, created by by Sinclair Research Ltd (now owned by Amstrad plc),
Amstrad was given permissions for distributing their ROM's with emulators, so they are
included in source of emulator (mod zx::roms). More about this read [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.sys.amstrad.8bit/HtpBU2Bzv_U/HhNDSU3MksAJ)
